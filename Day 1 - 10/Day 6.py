#Question 16
##Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
#Then, the output should be:
#1,3,5,7,9


value = input()
lst = [x for x in value.split(",") if int(x)%2!=0 ]
print(lst)


#Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
#D 100
#W 200

#D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#D 300
#D 300
#W 200
#D 100
#Then, the output should be:
#500

netAmount = 0
while True:
    s = input()
    if not s:
        break
    values = s.split(" ")
    operation = values[0]
    amount = int(values[1])
    if operation=="D":
        netAmount+=amount
    elif operation=="W":
        netAmount-=amount
    else:
        pass
print(netAmount)

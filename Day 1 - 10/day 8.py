### Question 21
Level 3

Question
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
¡­
The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
Then, the output of the program should be:
2

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:

```python
import math
pos = [0,0]
while True:
    s = input()
    if not s:
        break
    movement = s.split(" ")
    direction = movement[0]
    steps = int(movement[1])
    if direction=="UP":
        pos[0]+=steps
    elif direction=="DOWN":
        pos[0]-=steps
    elif direction=="LEFT":
        pos[1]-=steps
    elif direction=="RIGHT":
        pos[1]+=steps
    else:
        pass
print(int(round(math.sqrt(pos[1]**2+pos[0]**2))))
```

### Question 22
Level 3

Question:
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Hints
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:

```python
freq = {}   # frequency of words in text
line = input()
for word in line.split():
    freq[word] = freq.get(word,0)+1
words = freq.keys()
words.sort()
for w in words:
    print("%s:%d" % (w,freq[w]))
```

### Question 23
level 1

Question:
Write a method which can calculate square value of number

Hints:
Using the ** operator

Solution:

```python
def square(num):
    return num ** 2
print(square(2))
print(square(3))
```
